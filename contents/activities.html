   <h2>Examination Reforms</h2> 
   <p>The activities of KRMSS commenced with an important initiative to bring about a change in the functioning of examination at the state level.  Initially this began with the examination issues of Karnataka University Dharwad (KUD). 
    KRMSS invited the VC and his team of officials of KUD for having a series of discussions with its stakeholders – the teachers, students, syndicate members and political administrators for a Round Table Meet. The meet which was convened on Sept 2nd 2015 was attended by nearly 100 participants. The discussion raised issues like:
    <ol>
        <li><em>Review of Internal Assessment System at the UG level.</em></li>
        <li><em>Online admission and examination (OMR) forms </em></li>
        <li><em>Creating a KUD intranet with four stage login</em></li>
        <li><em>Co-ordination and linkage between exam section and academic section of the university needs to be strengthened.</em></li>
        <li><em>Providing the affiliated colleges with online retrievable ledgers with MS-office compatibility so as to facilitate result analysis</em></li>
        <li><em>Students grievance mechanism</em>
        <dt>Single window solution </dt>
        <dt>issues relating online application,revaluation, recounting, scanned copy of answer scripts</dt>
        </li>
        <li><em>Teachers’ Grievances / Problems (Remuneration, Evaluation Facilities, Etc..)</em></li>
        <li><em>Paper setting and evaluation system</em></li>
        <li><em>Accountability </em></li>
    </ol>
    It was a successful intervention by KRMSS, as the meet not only brought to table the issues but also provided time-bound implementable solutions. As a result in subsequent follow ups that were done with the university, nearly 70 percent of issues were resolved.
